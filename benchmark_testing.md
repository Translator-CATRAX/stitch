# `normalize_kg2pre.py` Benchmark Testing
Trial Name | Commit | Start Time | End Time | Run Time | Peak Memory Usage | Size (bytes) | Notes
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
Base Trial | [3a7bf70](https://github.com/Translator-CATRAX/stitch/commit/3a7bf70f0dafbc7c955196e6cb30b2f8bfce604d) | `Sun Aug  3 05:07:07 UTC 2025` | `Sun Aug  3 10:25:24 UTC 2025` | 5 hours, 18 minutes, 17 seconds | 31% (on `r5a.4xlarge`) | 14958920 | The memory tracker was started about 1 hour and 9 minutes into the build.
JSONLines Streaming System | [7f70612](https://github.com/Translator-CATRAX/stitch/commit/7f7061204234bab174d19f68a129d32a479a7996) | `Mon Aug  4 23:45:24 UTC 2025` | `Tue Aug  5 02:59:38 UTC 2025` | 3 hours, 14 minutes, 14 seconds | 2% (on `r5a.4xlarge`) | 14959840 | This wasn't run on a fresh instance. (Base Trial had already been run; this test was also started but abandoned about 40 minutes into the build after I realized I forgot to measure memory usage. I am unclear whether this would have impacted the indices.) The script used was `normalize_kg2pre_jsonlines.py`. Additionally, I can't run a direct comparison on content because the Base Trial had unsorted keys while this trial had sorted keys in the JSONLines file. I am unclear why this file is 80 bytes smaller. It does not seem to be a systemic error or I would expect the difference to be significantly larger.
